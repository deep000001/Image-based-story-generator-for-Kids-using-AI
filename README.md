# StorytoImageGenerator
This project demonstrates using OpenAI's AI capabilities to automatically create an image based on a short story generated by the AI. It uses the text-davinci-002 engine to generate a 100 word story from a given prompt. Then it feeds that story into the Image generation API to create a 1024x1024 pixel image representing the story. The image is downloaded and saved locally.
This shows how versatile AI models like OpenAI can be for creative applications. By chaining together the text and image generation, it is possible to automatically visualize written stories and concepts. This could be useful for illustrating stories, generating art from writing prompts, or enhancing game development workflows. While the quality is not always perfect, it is an impressive demonstration of AI's generative capabilities.
